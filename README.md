NeuroLark
An AI-powered offline voice assistant designed to help dementia patients with memory support, reminders, and guided interactions.

NeuroLark is an offline-capable voice assistant designed to support dementia patients by offering reminders, answering memory-related questions in times of need, and maintaining routines all through natural voice interactions. The idea of Neurolark is that patients with memory related issues can utilize iot or wearable tech, or even their regular cellular devices and headphones to be able to continue their lives as it was prior to memory decline. The main goal of this application is to make sure that cognitive decline in any aspect will not impact the life quality of human beings.
